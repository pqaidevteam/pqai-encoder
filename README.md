# PQAI Encoder

PQAI service for transforming data into representations suitable as inputs for machine-learning pipelines. For example, transforming a piece of text into an embedding in a high-dimensional vector space.

The following representations are supported at the moment:

1. Text -> Dense embedding
1. Text -> Sequence of word vectors
1. Text -> Bag of entities


For more detailed information, please refer to [PQAI Wiki](https://github.com/pqaidevteam/pqai/wiki/pqai-encoder).
